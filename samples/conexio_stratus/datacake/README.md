# Connecting Stratus to Datacake via MQTT
This MQTT sample demonstrates how to easily connect the Conexio Stratus device to the Datacake MQTT broker, send, and receive data.

### [ðŸ“£ Find our walk-through tutorial for this sample application â†’ here](https://www.rajeevpiyare.com/posts/stratus-to-datacake/)

## Requirements

The sample supports the Conexio Stratus development kit.


## Overview
The sample connects to the Datacake MQTT broker and publishes the data it receives on the configured subscribe topic to the 
configured publish topic. On a button press event, the application publishes the device vitals to the Datacake and 
periodically publishes the environmental data such as temperature and humidity.
By default, the sample can establish a secure (TLS) connection or a non-secure connection to the 
configured MQTT broker. The sample disables power saving modes (PSM and eDRX) so that network events are processed 
as soon as possible.

## Configuration
See the project `Kconfig` for different application configurations.

Add the Datacake credentials to the Application Code by editing the `prf.conf`.

```
# MQTT application configuration authentication
CONFIG_MQTT_PASS="DATACAKE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
CONFIG_MQTT_USER="DATACAKE_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

This configuration parameter sets the MQTT broker hostname and port.
```
# MQTT broker configuration
CONFIG_MQTT_BROKER_HOSTNAME="mqtt.datacake.co"
CONFIG_MQTT_BROKER_PORT=8883
```

This configuration parameter sets the MQTT Publish and Subscribe topics.
```
# MQTT topics for recording measurement values
# Change this as per your Datacake MQTT Integration and fields
CONFIG_MQTT_PUB_TOPIC_TEMP="dtck-pub/<product_slug>/<device_id>/TEMPERATURE"
CONFIG_MQTT_PUB_TOPIC_HUM="dtck-pub/<product_slug>/<device_id>/HUMIDITY"
CONFIG_MQTT_PUB_TOPIC_VER="dtck-pub/<product_slug>/<device_id>/VERSION"
CONFIG_MQTT_PUB_TOPIC_IMEI="dtck-pub/<product_slug>/<device_id>/IMEI"
CONFIG_MQTT_PUB_TOPIC_BAT="dtck-pub/<product_slug>/<device_id>/BATTERY"
CONFIG_MQTT_PUB_TOPIC_RSRP="dtck-pub/<product_slug>/<device_id>/RSRP"
CONFIG_MQTT_PUB_TOPIC_BUTTON="dtck-pub/<product_slug>/<device_id>/BUTTON"

# MQTT subscription topics
CONFIG_MQTT_SUB_TOPIC="dtck/<product_slug>/<device_id>/+"
```

**Note**

The CA certificate for the default MQTT broker is included in the project and automatically 
provisioned after boot if the sample is built with the TLS configuration.

## Building and running
To compile the application, open a terminal window in the application directory and issue the following `west` command.

For the Stratus Pro nrf9151/nRF9161 device, the west build command is: 
```
west build -b conexio_stratus_pro/nrf9161/ns -- -DBOARD_ROOT=/opt/nordic/ncs/v2.7.0/conexio-firmware-sdk
```

For the Stratus nRF9160 device, the build command is:
```
west build -b conexio_stratus/nrf9160/ns -- -DBOARD_ROOT=/opt/nordic/ncs/v2.7.0/conexio-firmware-sdk
```

Once the application is compiled successfully, connect the Stratus device and put it into the DFU mode.

Flash the compiled firmware using `newtmgr`
```
newtmgr -c serial image upload build/zephyr/app_update.bin
```

Open up a serial console and reset the Stratus device. 

## Sample output
The following serial UART output will be displayed in the terminal. 
If you are connecting your Stratus device for the first time, give it a few minutes to register to the network and establish 
the LTE connection with the tower.

You will notice that the Stratus connects to the Datacake MQTT broker after which it publishes the sensor data to the configured topics.
