## Edge Impulse: Data forwarder

The Edge Impulse data forwarder sample demonstrates the usage of `Edge Impulse's data forwarder` to provide sensor 
data to [Edge Impulse studio](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/).
The sample forwards Conexio Stratus onboard accelerometer data generated by the LIS2DH sensor.

## Requirements

The sample supports the following development kits:
- `conexio_stratus_ns`

## Overview

The sample periodically performs the following operations:

- Reads data from accelerometer sensor. The sample reads acceleration measurements for X, Y, and Z axes.
- Forwards the data through UART using the protocol specified by `Edge Impulse's data forwarder`.

**Note**:
   The sample uses UART only to forward the sensor data.
   For this reason, sample logs are provided through RTT.

## Configuration

Before running the sample, you must complete the following steps:

1. Prepare your own project using [Edge Impulse studio](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/) external web tool.
2. Follow the [Edge Impulse CLI installation guide](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/cli-installation) to install Edge Impulse command line tools.
   These tools are needed because the ``edge-impulse-data-forwarder`` is used to forward the data received from the device through UART to Edge Impulse studio.
